/********************************************************************** 
A problem: processing measurement data 
Temperature readings are taken in one and the same place for a couple 
of weeks. The readings are taken regularly  the same number of 
readings each week. At the end of the measurement period the collected 
data is to be processed: for each week the least, the greatest and the 
average temperature is to be determined. The least, greatest and 
average temperature for the whole period is also to be computed. 
A solution to the problem 
This program reads the temperatures and displays them. Then the least, 
greatest and average temperature for each week is computed and stored. 
These results are printed on the standard output device. Finally, the 
least, greatest and average temperature over the whole measurement 
period is decided. These results are also printed on the standard 
output device.
